# Change Log

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

## [2.3.0] - 2024-03-19

### Add

- Support for visionOS. Now APNGKit can be used on visionOS in the native way. [#146](https://github.com/onevcat/APNGKit/pull/146)
- Privacy Manifest support. Although APNGKit is not tracking any user information nor using any APIs that require declaration, an empty privacy manifest file was added to the project to prevent any potential warning. [#144](https://github.com/onevcat/APNGKit/pull/144)

### Note

- To align with the latest build environment and Xcode, APNGKit now increases the minimum deployment target to iOS 12, macOS 10.14 and tvOS 12. [#145](https://github.com/onevcat/APNGKit/pull/145)


## [2.2.5] - 2023-12-11

### Fix

- A wrong condition check that caused the fix in 2.2.4 not to work as expected. [#141](https://github.com/onevcat/APNGKit/pull/141)

## [2.2.4] - 2023-12-09

### Fix

- A timing issue that on iOS 17 a wrong timestamp might be used when the image starts to play when the app is just going to start up. It caused the image to be played at the wrong speed. [#140](https://github.com/onevcat/APNGKit/pull/140) @alexander-steel @devflow @onevcat

## [2.2.3] - 2023-10-09

### Fix

- Use an alpha bitmap context to render images with true color (PNG ColorType 2). This allows the `tRNS` chunk to be handled correctly. [#138](https://github.com/onevcat/APNGKit/pull/138)

## [2.2.2] - 2023-05-04

### Fix

- Use `.info` log level for missing frames when decoding. This allows a better debugging experience when the image is not rendered as expected. [#129](https://github.com/onevcat/APNGKit/pull/129)
- Upgrade the project for Xcode 14.3. The deploy target version of demo app prevented it from building with Xcode 14.3. [#134](https://github.com/onevcat/APNGKit/pull/134)


## [2.2.1] - 2022-05-08

### Fix

- Wrong canvas parameter when the image header set to "true color". Now an image with non-alpha channel should be also read correctly. [#125](https://github.com/onevcat/APNGKit/pull/125) @onevcat

## [2.2.0] - 2022-03-12

### Add

- Support for setting a single `APNGImage` to multiple `APNGImageView`s. It lifts off the limitation in previous versions that an `APNGImage` can only be set to one `APNGImageView`. Now, it is free to be used in different image views and the image view controls the animation playing. [#124](https://github.com/onevcat/APNGKit/pull/124) @onevcat

## [2.1.2] - 2022-03-05

### Fix

- An issue that when the frame contains `APNG_DISPOSE_OP_PREVIOUS` or `APNG_DISPOSE_OP_BACKGROUND`, the output buffer does not reset in some cases. [#122](https://github.com/onevcat/APNGKit/pull/122) @onevcat

## [2.1.1] - 2021-12-15

### Fix

- An issue introduced in 2.1.0 that the background was not clear before rendering the next frame when `dispose_op` is `previous`. [#118](https://github.com/onevcat/APNGKit/pull/118) @onevcat

## [2.1.0] - 2021-12-09

### Add

- Expose the `APNGFrame` type and related properties in `APNGImage` to allow getting some basic information by frame. [#117](https://github.com/onevcat/APNGKit/pull/117) @onevcat

### Fix

- An issue that wrong area is reverted when `dispose_op` is set to `previous` and the render area is not the full canvas. [#117](https://github.com/onevcat/APNGKit/pull/117) @onevcat

## [2.0.2] - 2021-11-17

### Fix

- An issue that the PNG decoder would fail to render frames when there are image shared chunks between `acTL` and the first actual image frame. [#114](https://github.com/onevcat/APNGKit/pull/114) @onevcat

## [2.0.1] - 2021-11-02

### Fix

- Swift Package Manager now can resolve this package in Xcode. [#112](https://github.com/onevcat/APNGKit/pull/112)

## [2.0.0] - 2021-11-01
